== Description ==

Strictly Tweetbot is designed to allow site owners to post automatic twitter messages to one or more accounts whenever an article is added to a site.

This plugin is ideal for people who regularly import content into their sites and want to make sure that one or more twitter accounts have their statuses updated with details of newly posted articles. The variety of configuration options available help you create unique tweets for each post as well as deciding whether or not to post by analysing the articles content.

Features


* Post to multiple accounts OR post multiple messages to the same account with different formats.
* Easy to authenticate using the new OAuth method. No need to register your plugin as a consumer application.
* Format your messages with easy to use placeholders e.g %title% %url% %hashtags%
* Add tracking codes (e.g Google Analytics) to the article URL BEFORE it is shortened to track inbound traffic from tweets.
* Use your categories or post tags as the source for your hash tags or use default hash tags.
* Dashboard report keeps you informed of status updates or failures.
* Automatic hookup to my Strictly AutoTags plugin so that any post tags generated by it can be used as #hashtags in tweets.
* Help prevent a Twitter Rush by fetching your new article BEFORE tweets are sent out (see http://blog.strictly-software.com/2011/11/twitter-rush-caused-by-tweet-bots.html)
* Use content analysis to decide whether or not to post a tweet to a certain account or not. Options include All Words, Any Word, No Words and Always Post.
* Set up an ignore list of words that prevent a tweet being sent out.
* Use either the popular Tweet Shrink API to shorten tweets before posting or my own Text Shrink (text speak) function OR both.



== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Download the plugin.
2. Unzip the strictly-tweetbot compressed file.
3. Upload the directory strictly-tweetbot to the /wp-content/plugins directory on your WordPress blog.
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

7. Verify your accounts by clicking the link that is provided. Once you have authenticated the Twitter account you will be given a PIN which
   you must enter into the appropriate input box. On saving the account will check the PIN and verify the account.
8. If you have an error messages installing the plugin then please try the following to rule out conflicts with other plugins
	-disable all other plugins and then try to re-activate the Strictly TweetBot plugin - some caching plugins cause issues and other Twitter plugins
	 may also cause problems if they are using the same objects.
	-if that worked, re-enable the plugins one by one to find the plugin causing the problem. Decide which plugin you want to use.
	-if that didn't work check you have the latest version of the plugin software (from Wordpress) and the latest version of Wordpress installed
	-Check you have Javascript and Cookies enabled.
	-If you can code turn on the DEBUG constant and debug the code to find the problem otherwise contact me and offer me some money to fix the issue :)
	-Please remember that you get what you pay for so you cannot expect 24 hour support for a free product. Please bear that in mind if you decide to email me. A donation button
	 is on my site and in the plugin admin page.
	-If you must email me and haven't chosen to donate even the smallest amount of money please read this >> http://blog.strictly-software.com/2011/10/naming-and-shaming-of-programming.html


Help 

1. Use the "Test Configuration" button at the bottom to check that all your configuration options are working correctly.
2. Check the messages at the top for any errors to do with invalid Bit.ly API keys or other issues.
3. Check that Twitter is not returning error messages such as "Duplicate Tweets" or other errors.
4. Ensure JavaScript is enabled.
5. Ensure your server has allowed you access to make remote HTTP calls through the use of CURL/FSockOpen/file_get_contents etc.
6. Check other plugins are not causing problems by de-activating ALL of them apart from Strictly TweetBot
7. Check the message forums on WordPress > http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/strictly-tweetbot
8. If your question/problem is not there add one.
9. If you must email me please provide all relevant information about the version of WordPress, the plugin, browser, server, twitter accounts and provide screenshots as well.
